Class D4D_Intercept play
{	
	/* Summary:
    **  Calculates the future position of a moving target so that a projectile launched immediately can hit it.
    **  Taken from the GameDev.net article "Shooting at stuff" (https://www.gamedev.net/articles/programming/math-and-physics/shooting-at-stuff-r3884/)
    **  Modified for use in 3D in GZDoom by Chronos "phantombeta" Ouroboros.
	**	Further modified by Major Cooke.
    **  Dual-licensed under the GPL2 and Zlib licenses - this function can be used under the terms of either license.
    **
    ** Arguments:
    **  projPos: The projectile's position.
    **  targetPos: The target's position.
    **  targetVel: The target's velocities.
    **  projSpeed: The projectile's speed.
    **
    ** Returns:
    **  The position that the intercept will occur at. The function will return null if a solution cannot be found.
    **  Consider the case of a target moving away from the shooter faster than the speed of the projectile and you will see at least one case where this calculation may fail.
