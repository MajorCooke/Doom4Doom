//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this section I will just cover the most "obscure" yet useful pieces of 
information.

0.1 If you are low on any ammo type, and "Drop loot" option is "on", upon
    dying, monsters will drop ammo of the weapons you need ammo for. Only 
    exceptions are BFG and Chainsaw ammo.

0.2 Syphon grenades are there to keep you healthy. The more monsters hit by
    this grenade, the more you will heal. 

0.3 Hologram "grenade" will always attract monsters to attack it. Use this to
    distract them while you reposition yourself to avoid incoming damage

0.4 Pinkies have a frontal shield. It absorbs PART of the damage, however, they
    are completely vulnerable to any piercing rounds, explosives, and also
    the shield does not protect them from your pistol, fists or Chainsaw.
    Spectres lack their shielding.

0.5 D4D Archviles will teleport away from you if you get too close. Snipe on 
    them to take them down.

0.6 Any monster hit with by the BFG lasers, will die as soon as the BFG shot
    explodes, no matter how far away it crashes from the monsters. Only
    exceptions are the Cyberdemon and SpiderMastermind

0.7 Monsters killed with Berserk or Chainsaw's primary fire, will ALWAYS drop
    health.

0.8 Monsters killed with the Chainsaw's secondary fire, will ALWAYS drop ammo.

0.9 Monsters killed with the Chainsaw's primary will give out twice as many 
    credits as they normally would. When killed with the secondary, they will 
    drop x4 the amount of credits.

0.10 Monsters can be weakened with other weapons, then killed with the
     Chainsaw alt fire, to save some Chainsaw ammo. If you weaken it enough
     with other weapons first, you can even Chainsaw-execute a cyberdemon or
     a SpiderMastermind and get waaaay more credits than you'd expect! $$$$



//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 . * Keybindings * 

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The mod has quite a few custom keys to use. Make sure to go under
   D4D options -> Customize Keybinds

1.1  Upgrade Menu: This is to access the upgrade menu, if the name wasn't
     explicit enough.

1.2  Switch Weapon Mod: Whenever you get your first mod for a weapon, this will
     equip it. Whenever you get a second mod for the same weapon, this will 
     switch between the mods.

1.3  Melee Attack: Throws a quick punch while you are holding any weapon. Will
     finish a staggering monster, making it drop health.

1.4  Select Next/Previous Grenade Type. Since you can get up to 3 types, these
     keys are to cycle between them. In game, you will see the icon and name
     of the grenade change as you press this key.

1.5  Throw Grenade: Once you have found any of the 3 types of grenades in
     game, this key is gonna throw one.

     * Special Use *

1.6  Buy Crate (500cr): At any point in game, you can press this key and 
     it will spawn a random item for the price of 500 credits. Good for when 
     you just don't have anything else to buy in the upgrade store. This
     crate can be upgraded (through upgrade menu) to contain better items.

1.7  Brofist (when available): Because you know you want to do it again.

1.8  Chaingun Special Mode: Triggers the "special mode" of the chaingun if
     the required criteria is met.

1.9  Panic Button (clear gibs): As it says, by pressing this key, all gibs in 
     the current map will disappear. Good for if you went too overboard with the
     gore settings and it's lagging on you.

1.10  Weapon Keybinds: In this sub menu, you can bind weapons to keys per slot
      or per weapon.



//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2 . * Glory Kill options * 

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

D4D has a glory kill system which by default consist of this behaviour:
If a monster is weak enough, it will enter a "staggered" state where will be
unable to move or attack for four seconds. During this time, the monster will
be highlighted to indicate that you can perform a glory kill on the monster by
hitting it with the quick melee key. If the monster is not killed quickly, it
will heal itself by a small amount, and proceed to behave as usual.

Many aspects of this system can be customized.

2.1 Melee Execution Monster Switch: Enables or completely disables the options
    of the glory kill system. When "OFF", all the settings below will be ignored
    and none of the special behaviour will take place. Default "ON".

2.2 Glory Kill Animations: When "ON", upon hitting a staggered/highlighted monster
    with a quick melee attack, will perform a "finisher" animation (glory kill)
    on the monster. When "OFF", in the same scenario, only a deadly punch will
    be delivered, instead of locking the player into the animation. Default "ON".

2.3 Monster Highlight When Weak: When "ON", if a monster is weakened enough, it
    will display a highlight on itself signifying it's vulnerability to be
    quicly executed with a quick melee attack. When "OFF", the monster will NOT
    display the highlight when weakened, however, it will still be vulnerable
    to the execution. Read 2.x below for how it combines with point 2.4.

2.4 Monster Stagger When Weak: When ON, a weakened monster will enter the 
    "stagger" state which will make them unable to move or attack for a period of 
    time. When "OFF" the monster will NOT be staggered when weakened, however, it
    will still be vulnerable to the execution. Read 2.x below for how it combines
    with point 2.3.

2.5 Noisy Staggered Monsters: If "monster stagger" is ON, this option will make
    the staggered monsters play the "pain" sound at intervals of one second.
    When "OFF", even if a monster is staggered, no pain sound will be played.
    Default "ON".

2.6 Stagger/Highlight (in seconds): Determines the amount of seconds a weakened
    monster will be staggered and/or highlighted. Default "4". Note: Cyberdemon
    and SpiderMastermind monsters will only stagger/highlight for half of the
    time set in this option.


2.x The behaviour of 2.3 and 2.4 are completely independent. Here's a simple
    list of scenarios and how it works

    a) Stagger ON, Hihglight ON: When monster is weakened, it will stagger
       and be highlighted for the amount of time set in 2.6. The monster is
       vulnerable to glory kills during this time.

    b) Stagger ON, Highlight OFF: When monster is weakened, it will stagger
       but not be highlighted. Vulnerable to glory kill while staggered.

    c) Stagger OFF, Highlight ON: When monster is weakened, it will not stagger
       which allows the monster to behave as usual, walk, attack, etc., but it
       will be highlighted for the amount of time set in 2.6. Note: The highlight
       will look different than the highlight shown in a) or b), this is due to
       technical limitations.

    d) Stagger OFF, Highlight OFF: when a monster is weakened, it will not 
       stagger, nor it will be highlighted, however, IT WILL STILL BE VULNERABLE
       TO GLORY KILL for the amount of time set in 2.6; however, as you might
       imagine, without any indication of the monster being weak enough, it will
       be really hard to figure out if he's actually vulnerable to GK or not.

Remember, turning 2.3 and 2.4 off, does NOT MEAN that glory kills system is OFF.
For that use option 2.1.



//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2 . * Gore options * 

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Also found under Options, here you can adjust how much gore you want in the game.
General rule is: The more you increase these numbers, the laggier the game will get.


2.1 Panic command: Similar to the "Panic button" it will clear the gibs in the map
    but this one, from the menu, rather than by a keybind.

2.2 Bullet Giblets: How many flying giblets will appear randomly for every shot
    than hits a monster. Default is "1".

2.3 Splatter Giblets: How many giblets will spawn when a monster is exploded. 
    Default is "5".

2.4 Blood Clouds: Another part of the extreme death of monsters. Default is "5".

2.5 Blood Trails: Do the spawned giblets leave blood trails as they fly? 
    Default "on".

2.6 Blood FX type: You can choose between having all blood effects be rendered as
    "Sprites", "Particles" or both.

2.7 Short Gib life: When "On", it will make all gibs disappear quite quickly instead
    of laying on the floor for a while. Default "off".

2.8 SuperShotgun Gibs Monsters: In Doom4 the SSG tends to gib monsters constantly,
    however, in here you can choose between "sometimes" (not all monsters will
    gib all the time), "Always" (will gib no matter what or how far) or "Never"
    (will not gib at all).

2.9 Restore Giblet Defaults: By selecting this option, all custom gore settings will
    reset to default. Requires confirmation.

    ** Special section **

2.10 Bullet Giblets Unleashed
2.11 Splatter Giblets Unleashed

     Both of these are the same as 2.2 and 2.3 respectively, but in this section
     you can increase the number up to 10k. This is NOT RECOMMENDED as it will
     probably make your computer explode because of so many instructions to process. 
      - You have been warned -



//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3 . * Display options * 

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here you can change several settings of how D4D displays some stuff.

    ** D4D Messages **

3.1 Performance/V-Noise Master switches: The options here disable a lot of visual
    effects, which in theory should improve performance since much less stuff
    will be on screen at all times. However, by removing all the visual effects,
    you are getting rid of a lot of visual noise, which is good for some players'
    play-style. Use at your discretion.
3.1.1 Monster HQ Effects: Toggles monsters high quality effects on/off. This
      affects all their projectile trails and extra visual effects. They become
      much more simplistic visually, but the behavior remains the same. This also
      removes some "flame charging" effects from Imps and Baron of hell. This
      option affects monster type D4D and Classic Doom types.
3.1.2 Weapons HQ Effects: Toggles weapons high quality effects on/off. This affects
      the smoke released by the weapon barrel and the projectiles' trails. However
      this option does NOT affect other weapon settings like: casings spawning, 
      tracer effects or explosion quakes, since all these have their own
      switches.

3.2 Message Style
3.2.1 Doom-esque: Will show the D4D quota messages with a small font in the lower 
      side of the screen. Default.
3.2.2 Arcade: Will display the messages in a bigger and more "festive" style.
3.2.3 None: Will not show them at all.

3.3 Show Monster Quota: Toggle to show/hide all monster quota messages.

3.4 Show Secret Quota: Toggle to show/hide the secret found messages.


    ** Effects Options **
    * Weapons *
3.5 Spawn casings: Toggles if any casings will spawn from the player's weapon

3.6 Short casing lives: Toggles between having casings disappear almost
    immediately (for performance gain) or have them stay there for a while
    before disappearing.

3.7 Silent Casings: Toggles if you want casings to play a sound or not.

3.8 Bullet Tracer Effects
3.8.1 Model: Uses a 3d model to show the weapon tracer effects.
3.8.2 Particle: Uses a particle based projectile for the tracers.
3.8.3 Trail: Uses an instant trail showing the trajectory, a beam of light.
3.8.4 Particle Trail: Combines both "particle" and "trail" options.
3.8.5 None: No tracers at all.

3.9 BFG Lasers: Toggles on/off the visual effect of the BFG lasers when
    it attacks monsters. Turn this off if the BFG lags too much for you.
    Default is "on".

3.10 ZDoom Crosshair: Since D4D includes custom reticles, ZDoom's crosshair 
     is recommended to be OFF (none).


    * Other effects *
3.11 Monster Lazers: Toggles between "Fancy" and "Faster" lazer effects for some
     monsters. This is particularly relevant in cases where there are too
	 many laser monsters at the same time, as it can have a big hit in performance.

3.12 Voxels: Toggle voxels on/off. If you turn this off, visual glitches will
     occur, yet it might help with performance in some extreme cases. GZDOOM RESETS
     THIS VALUE BACK TO "ON" EVERY TIME YOU OPEN GZDOOM.

3.13 Blood HUD effect: Toggles on/off the effect of blood splattered on screen when
     you take damage (this only appears when you have no armor). Default "on".

3.14 Rocket Explosion Quakes: Toggles on/off quake effects when explosions
     happen near you. On by default.

3.15 Particle Type: To select whether you want square, round or smooth zdoom
     particles.
    
3.16 Max Amount of Particles: It is suggested to go as high as possible, since
     D4D uses a lot of particles for all the effects.

3.17 Max Fx Render Distance
3.18 Max Fx Dist (faster)
     These two options changes how far away from player will some fx stop rendering,
     The second option increases the number much faster than the first.
    



//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4 . * D4D General Options * 

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General options that you might want to change right away

    ** Gameplay options **

4.1 Monster type:
4.1.1 D4D: This replaces all vanilla monsters with their D4D counterpart. These
      monsters are more aggressive and more challenging than their vanilla
      versions. This is the default, since the mod was balanced towards using
      these. Monsters have no undodgeable attacks, but their projectiles are
      much faster than the vanilla doom monsters. Almost all of the D4D
      monsters use custom graphics.
4.1.2 Original Doom: They look and behave like vanilla. No changes to any of
      their values, being health, damage, or speed. They only have slighly
      visually updated projectile attacks, but the behavior remains the same.
      These monsters are the "easy" ones compared to D4D.

4.2 Monster Drop Loot: Toggles on/off the loot monsters might drop when they
    are killed in a variety of ways. This does not affect the ammo they would
    drop in vanilla Doom. When "off" Chainsaw finishers (Chainsaw alt fire)
    will still drop ammo, but much less.

4.3 Double Jump: Toggles on/off the ability to perform a double jump. This is
    recommened to use at your own discretion, since vanilla maps are not
    designed with jumping in mind, much less double jumping. However, if you
    do have double jump enabled, it's highly recommended to set SV_AIRCONTROL
    on the console to 0.2.

4.4 Ledge Grabbing: Toggles on/off the ability to grab ledges. Much like 
    "double jump", use at your own discration. It can lead to some unexpected
	results, and allow to climb to places you werent supposed to reach. 
	Default "On"

4.5 Syphon Strength: This affects how much health/armor the syphon grenade
    gives when hitting monsters. "Easy" gives more health, while "hard" gives
    less.


    ** Monster behaviour **

4.5 Archvile Monster Infights: By default, D4D archviles cannot be targetted
    by other monsters. When you turn this on, they can be targeted by other 
    monsters to cause infights.
	
4.6 D4D HellKnight Melee Only: Toggles ON/OFF the HK being able to only
    perform melee attacks. When this is ON, HK will be faster and more
	aggressive, and still be able to perform "Leap" attacks, but not
	projectile attacks. When This is OFF, HK will be regular speed,
	and also able to do projectile attacks.


    ** Demon Runes **
	
4.8 Spawn Demon Runes: This option allows you to choose how often do
    you want demon runes to spawn in the game.
	OFF: Runes will never spawn
	Common: Runes will be fairly easy to get
	Rare:  Runes will be difficult to find
	
4.9 Silent Idle Demon-Player: Toggles ON/OFF. Default "ON". A demon player
    will by default play idle noises at random intervals. Setting this
	option to "OFF" will prevent these sounds from playing.
	
4.10 Show HUD Demon Name: Default YES. Displays the name of the demon you
     morphed into, for as long as you're morphed.

4.11 Demon Rune Warning: Default ON. Displays a warning to not save/load
     nor exit a level while morphed. "When ON" message displays for as long
	 as you are in demon form.

    ** Multiplayer Weapons **

4.12 Multiplayer Weapons Spawn in SP: Toggles ON/OFF the spawning of the Doom4
     multiplayer weapons that are included in D4D. When OFF, these weapons
     (Lightning Gun, Static Rifle, Vortex Rifle, Repeater, Carrion Cannon*) will 
	 no longer spawn in game.
	 * Carrion Cannon: This is the former "Hellshot". 

4.13 Spawn Style: Determines how are the MP weapons going to spawn throughout
     the game. 
	 -Progressive (default): The MP weapons will spawn based on the weapons
	  you already have. A static rifle will only spawn until you have a 
	  Combat Shotgun, a LightningGun will spawn only until you have a Plasma
	  Rifle, etc. This is to space out the rate at which you obtain weapons in
	  the game. Recommended for multiple-map wads, since it relies on reaching 
	  the next level to spawn the new weapons.
	 -Random: MP weapons will spawn alongside any other weapon placed in the map.
	  This allows to get the MP weapons rather quickly. Recommended for single
	  huge maps, since it doesnt require player to reach new maps in order
	  for the weapons to spawn.
    NOTE: Regardless of which option is selected here, the Carrion Cannon
	still spawns under it's own rules. See section 5 "D4D Weapons" for more
	details.

    ** Footsteps **

4.14 Footsteps frequency: Alters how often footsteps are played. The higher the
     number, the more frequent the footsteps are.

4.15 Footsteps volume: Alters the volume of the footsteps. The higher the value,
     the louder the sounds.



//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5 . * Weapons *

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fist: Basic melee weapon. You should avoid using this one, since you have your
  blaster all the time, and it has infinite ammo. The fist is only useful for
  the Berserk powerup. Will perform glory kill automatically.

Blaster: Hitscan attack, unlimited ammo. While the weapon is weak, it's very easy
  to spam the primary fire and keep small monsters at bay. Alt fire will charge
  energy, when released, depending on the charge, is how much damage it will deal.
  The max charge shot will always be enough to take down an imp.
 - Upgrade 1, Faster Charge: Allows secondary fire to charge faster.
 - Upgrade 2, Secondary Damage: Charged shot will deal more damage.
 - Upgrade 3, Primary Damage: Increases damage for primary fire.
 - Upgrade 4, Full Auto: Allows the weapon to be fired continuously by holding
   the "fire" button. Tapping is still faster, but you now can save your mouse's
   lifespan a little longer. Heh.

Shotgun: You know how the regular shotgun works.
 - Trishot module: It fires 3 shots in a row, however, these are stronger than
   your regular shotgun shots, so it's pretty good to deal that extra chunk of 
   damage to those revenants. 
 - Explosive round: I call it "Grenade". It's basically a rocket affected by
   gravity. This projectile deals no impact damage, only explosive damage, so 
   you better aim it in a way it deals the most damage to several enemies.

Super Shotgun: Double barrelled fun.
 - NOTE: You can now turn Double Trouble on and off with the "Mod Switch" key at
        any time.
 - Upgrade 1, Faster Reload: Reloading faster means you can shoot again, sooner.
 - Upgrade 2, Piercing Shots: Penetrates all enemies.
 - Upgrade 3, Narrowed Cylinders: Increases the horizontal accuracy. Stacks VERY
        nicely with Piercing Shots.
 - Upgrade 4, Double Double Trouble trouble: 
    "DOUBLE THE GUN. DOUBLE THE FUN." - Serious Sam 2
    What's not to like about quick slinging two super shotguns that you can
    single OR dual fire both barrels? If mastered, one can easily stunlock 
    enemies into their pain states with enough practice.

Repeater: Semi auto, high precision hitscan. Primary fires a burst of 3 bullets.
   Secondary fires a flare shot.
 - Upgrade 1, Pierce Shot: Allows primary fire to pierce ONE target.
 - Upgrade 2, Primary Damage: Increases damage significantly while also 
   raising the ammo cost.
 - Upgrade 3, Secondary Damage: Flares will deal more damage over time.
 - Upgrade 4, Secondary Ammo: Decreases the ammo used by the alt fire.
   

Heavy Assault Rifle: Rapid fire hitscan. Simple enough.
 - Scope Module: Not only it gives you the ability to zoom, it also gives you
   piercing bullets that go through monsters.
 - Micro Missiles: And bottomless too. They stick into monsters and deal explosion
   damage. They might look weak, but once you stick enough of them into a monster
   you dont even have to worry about aiming at it. It'll just die.

Chaingun: Rotates. Shoots bullets. Really fast.
 - Gatling rotator: Similar to Doom4's, it rotates the barrels to have the weapon
   ready to fire at any time. However, it shoots explosive bullets. And they wreck.
 - Mobile Turret: When deployed, it will make you slower, but firing this thing
   means killing anything in front of you, quickly, so long as you have ammo for it.
 - ???: Rumor has it that someone has something special for you, should you put
   the effort into it... comrade.

Rocket Launcher: Launches a rocket.
 - Lock On: While you hold alt fire, it will attempt to lock to a monster you are
   aiming at. If successful, you'll see the monster marked. Press fire after that
   and three rockets will go after that one target. One target at the time folks.
 - Detonate: Alt fire detonates the "charges around the rocket", meaning, it will
   explode, but wont destroy the rocket. Time it well and you can deal a ton of
   damage to one single enemy.

Plasma Rifle: Projectile based, rapid fire weapon.
 - Heatblast: While equipped, it will passively build up heat. Alternatively, you
   can just "fire" and it will build the charge up much faster. Once you release
   the charge, things very close to you will very likely die. The damage depends
   on the amount of heat charged.
 - Stun Bomb: When the projectile hits something it will create a "stun explosion"
   paralyzing any monster near the explosion. Cyberdemons and Masterminds are 
   unaffected.

Lightning Gun: Your highly damaging, ammo eater, beam lightning gun.
 - Upgrade 1, Ammo Saving: Allows the weapon to use less ammo randomly.
 - Upgrade 2, Range: Increases the maximum range for the weapon.
 - Upgrade 3, Damage: Increases damage of the weapon all around.
 - Upgrade 4, Chain Lightning: Allows to use the chain lightning alt fire.
 
 Vortex Rifle: Basically a railgun, with a scope. Scope also increases damage
  ever so slightly. Primary fire pierces targes while unzoomed.
  - Upgrade 1, Extra Base Damage: Increases the non-scoped damage.
  - Upgrade 2, Ammo Saving: Allows the weapon to use less ammo per shot.
  - Upgrade 3, Zoom Movement: Removes the movement speed penalty when zooming.
  - Upgrade 4, Zoomed Pierce: Allows zoomed shots to pierce through targets.

Static Rifle: This one is easy. Unlimited ammo, but you MUST charge the weapon
   before you can fire it. You charge it by moving around. Once it has a charge,
   you can fire the laser-like attack. Depending on the charge level is the damage
   output. You should use this one for cool flick shots in the middle of a big arena
   while you run around like crazy. When fully charged, the shot will pierce
   monsters. Stayin still will slowly discharge the weapon.
 - Upgrade 1, Faster Charge: Charges faster.
 - Upgrade 2, Reduced Drain: Charges faster, charge drains slower.
 - Upgrade 3, Pierce Shots: All of the above, and shots pierce targets.
 - Upgrade 4, Multi Shot: Weapon allows several shots with one charge.

Gauss Cannon: Fires a laser-like powerful hitscan attack. Keep in mind if you're
   not on the floor, the weapon will push you in the opposite direction to where
   you are aiming. Meaning, you can technically do cool "Gauss Cannon jumping", or
   fall into a bottomless pit because you shot at the wrong time. 
 - Precision Shot: You can use a scope, and the weapon will charge. The bigger the
   charge, the more damage it deals. When the shot hits a target, it creates an
   explosion around it. Good for dealing with crowds.
 - Siege Mode: You will move like a snail when you have this deployed, but the shot 
   goes through monsters and deals a ton of damage to things around the beam. It 
   doesn't even have to hit them directly to devastate just about everything.
   Expensive as hell on the ammo though.

Chainsaw: It's both the chainsaw from the original Doom and Doom4.
 - Primary fire uses no ammo, and acts like the original doom's. Close and personal.
   Added bonus: Monsters killed with primary fire will always drop health and 
   DOUBLE the amount of credits given by the monster killed.
 - Secondary fire, it uses fuel ammo to perform a supercharged attack which will
   destroy whatever was in front of you, so long as you have the ammo to do so.
   Monsters killed with alt fire will drop x4 credits.
   (So many credits! One could do a "barrel" roll in excitement!)

BFG: Ammo is very scarce, but for good reason. The energy ball fired from this
   weapon fires argent beams to nearby monsters. Any monsters that were beamed,
   will die helplessly when the main projectile explodes. Also, the explosion is
   huge and kills just about anything around it. Cyberdemons and Masterminds are
   unnafected by the "death sentence" tagging of the argent beams. They, however,
   still take all the damage from the explosion. Everything dies with one shot,
   except those big mofos. They take two shots.
  - Upgrade 1, Ammo Capacity: Increases max BFG ammo by 1 (3 to 4).
  - Upgrade 2, Orbit Shot: Using alt fire, a BFG energy ball orbits the player. 
        It also electrocutes all nearby enemies. Passes through all objects but
        explodes with the same force as the primary.
  - Upgrade 3, Faster Shot: Projectile moves faster, lighning deals more damage.
  - Upgrade 4, Redirect Shot: "Switch Mod" key gains a use. While a BFG ball is
        flying (primary only), press the key to send the projectile towards the
        aimed location. This can only be done once per projectile.
   
Carrion Cannon: See below.
   
Grenades: The following 3 types of grenades are unlimited, but they have a
          regenerating time of about 10 seconds, is said time, you cannot use any 
          of the grenades.
 - Frag Grenade: If it hits a monster, it will explode on impact. If it doesn't hit a
   monster, it will start a quick fuse that will detonate it.
 - Holo Grenade: When used, it spawns in front of you a holographic marine that will
   attract all nearby monsters to attack it.
 - Syphon Grenade: Upon impact on a surface or object, it will detonate, creating an
   area of effect explosion. This will steal life or armor from the monsters caught 
   in the sphere.

- d4d_JumpExploit - 
Grants disproportionate jumping height when multi jump is tapped fast, by stacking z-speed.
This allows players to go flying sky high. Set this to true if you enjoy flying sky high. 
Not all the developers agree it was an exploit so we left it as a toggle, and this is your
reward for getting through this. Congratulations!

                                Carrion Cannon
================================================================================
- What kind of weapon is this?

    One you build from demon guts. 
    
    This weapon rivals the BFG where the BFG struggles, against singular big 
    targets like the Cyberdemon and Spider Mastermind. This weapon is excellent
    for wiping out blind spots and ambush corners where enemies can usually
    rain Hell down upon you from afar with annoyingly pin point accuracy. 
    You can also dish out lots of damage by charging out of sight after 
    hooking an enemy on the run and blowing them apart without needing to be 
    in view.

- How do I get it?
    
    You will need to acquire an uncertain amount of carrion which drops from
    GIBBED ENEMIES. Gotta make 'em go SPLAT. Pick up the pinkish red bullets
    (ewww) to further the progress. It will take a while, however. The more
    monsters are available for the WAD you play, the more likely you'll wrack 
    up the necessary amount to earn it (Chillax, anyone? ;))
    
- How do I use it?

                           --- Primary Fire ---
    Press and hold. The weapon shoots out a projectile that seeks after
    the nearest enemy. Costs no ammo to shoot or miss. When it connects
    with an enemy, it will latch on and start sucking out carrion from 
    your supply. FAST. Drains 14 carrion per tic, or 1000 over 2 seconds.
    For every tic carrion is consumed, the damage increases by ~75. 
    Hint: 800 Carrion is enough to kill a Cyberdemon.
    
    Let go of the primary at any time while hooked to detonate.
    
                           --- Secondary Fire ---
    Opens portals over a maximum of five enemies and spills forth a
    column of fire. This fire cannot be dodged and will always hit the
    target. Consumes 500 carrion no matter how many portals are opened,
    but the fewer targets there are, the stronger the flame.
    
                            --- Mod Switch ---
    Absorbs all nearby corpses, feeding you with double the carrion per
    corpse. Simply put, non-gibbed enemies have lots more to harvest
    from. 'Nuff said.
    
- Upgrade 1, Decay Minimizer: Each carrion pickup provides more ammo.
- Upgrade 2, Cell Purifier: Decreases ammo cost of each shot.
- Upgrade 3, Vorpal Stinger: Primary pains the target every 7 tics.
- Upgrade 4, Argent Accumulator: Alt fire portals last longer.

7. * Demon Runes * 

//------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	***NOTE:***
	To prematurely end a morph, simply press your "Mod Switch" key.

	Demon runes drop from various enemies, spanning the range of the 
	cacodemon to the cyberdemon and spider mastermind (in terms of Doom 
	caste, excluding the lost soul). All of them last for one minute and
	grant vast demonic powers to the wielder. All morphs have a primary
	and secondary attack.
	
	The runes themselves will vanish after a minute. However, that timer
	is frozen if you have a pentagram of protection or are already morphed.
	This allows you to return to the area and use another rune after the
	pentagram/morph expires.
	
	Once a morph expires, you have three seconds of invulnerability. Use
	it to get away from a sticky situation immediately.
