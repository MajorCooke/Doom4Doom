# Features
Have an idea? You can either open an Issue here on Github or you can make a suggestion for it on our discord server. 
Bear in mind, issue-based suggestions opened here are much easier to keep track of

# Issues
Found a bug? Please specify in the title what version number via brackets you're using. I.e.
* [Alpha #] - Indicates the bug is in the 3.0 Alpha # version.
* [Git] - Indicates the bug is present in the github. Please include a link to which commit you are using if possible.

The following issues will be closed on sight:
* [2.0.3-] - This and earlier versions are no longer supported, as the mod has moved on.
* [Non-OpenGL Renderers] - The old Carmack ZDoom renderer support was dropped in favor of slowly gaining increased multiplayer support and higher quality visuals.

# Contribution Rules
These rules are for contributing directly towards Doom4Doom via pull requests.

1. **No DECORATE or ACS allowed.** 
  * DECORATE is now deprecated entirely. There's not a shred of DECORATE left except for the damagetypes.
  * Anything you can do in ACS can now be done in ZScript. If you need help, ask.
2. **Detail your commits.** 
  * You must specify all that has changed if you wish to have a higher chance of acceptance.
3. **Notify us of defects/caveats.**  
  * If you know there are issues or problems, tell us and we'll help you work out what said problems are.
4. **Rejections may not be final.** 
  * If you're asked to change something, the Pull Request may be left open. This depends on how big and complex the code is.
  * Pull requests may be contested with the primary developers at any time, which may delay the process.
  * If a PR is ultimately declined for a specific permanent reason, it is considered final and should be dropped.
5. **Use a program like SourceTree or GitKraken (or the Git CLI) to upload files.**
  * Avoid using GitHub directly. With the aforementioned programs, you can commit all your files at once versus one at a time.
  * You only need one of these.
  * SourceTree: https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/
  * GitKraken: https://www.gitkraken.com/
  * Git CLI: https://git-scm.com
6. **Use proper indentation.**
  * Tabs, not spaces, should be used when making adjustments. Thus, you should use a programmer's notepad or SLADE to perform the edits.
7. **Notify us.**
  * While I do have the email system set up, sometimes I miss the notification from being gone.
